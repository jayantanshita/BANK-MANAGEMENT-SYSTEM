Hey guys...
This is a simple and my initial project which I made while I was learning C++ language.
I learnt about classes, object, functions, switch case and do while loops through this project.
This is a BANKING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM which takes entry and offers choices such as DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, DISPLAY, OPENING BALANCE, ETC.
